## Test Patterns Used

### 1. Fixture Pattern
Using `loadFixture` for efficient test isolation and faster execution.

### 2. Role-Based Testing
Multiple signers representing different roles (owner, therapists, patients, unauthorized).

### 3. Setup Helpers
Reusable helper functions for complex test scenarios.

### 4. Event Verification
Testing event emission with correct parameters.

### 5. Revert Testing
Comprehensive error condition testing.

### 6. State Verification
Checking contract state before and after operations.

## Test Quality Metrics

| Category | Coverage |
|----------|----------|
| **Functions** | 100% |
| **Lines** | > 95% target |
| **Branches** | > 90% target |
| **Statements** | > 95% target |

## Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npx hardhat test test/PrivateRehabRecords.test.js
npx hardhat test test/PrivateRehabRecords.expanded.test.js

# Run with gas reporting
REPORT_GAS=true npm test

# Generate coverage report
npm run coverage

# Run tests with verbose output
npm test -- --verbose
```

## Expected Test Output

```
PrivateRehabRecords
  Deployment
    ✓ Should set the correct owner
    ✓ Should initialize record counter to 1
    ✓ Should have zero total records initially

  Therapist Authorization
    ✓ Should allow owner to authorize therapist
    ✓ Should not allow non-owner to authorize therapist
    ✓ Should allow owner to revoke therapist authorization
    ...

  [Total: 93+ passing tests]
```

## Continuous Integration

Recommended CI/CD workflow includes:

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Compile contracts**
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

3. **Run test suite**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. **Generate coverage**
   ```bash
   npm run coverage
   ```

5. **Check coverage thresholds**
   - Statements: > 95%
   - Branches: > 90%
   - Functions: 100%
   - Lines: > 95%

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. Choose appropriate test file
2. Follow naming conventions
3. Use loadFixture for setup
4. Include assertions for:
   - State changes
   - Event emissions
   - Error conditions
5. Update this summary

### Best Practices

- ✅ Each test should be independent
- ✅ Use descriptive test names
- ✅ Test both success and failure cases
- ✅ Verify events and state changes
- ✅ Include edge case testing
- ✅ Maintain high coverage (>95%)

## Known Limitations

1. **FHE Operations**: The current tests use mock FHE operations since the contract uses Zama's FHE library. For full FHE testing:
   - Deploy to Zama's testnet
   - Use fhEVM testing tools
   - Implement encrypted input/output testing

2. **Gas Costs**: Gas costs may vary on actual network vs Hardhat network

3. **Time-Dependent Tests**: Some tests may need time manipulation for timestamp validation

## Compliance with Testing Standards

This test suite meets the requirements from `CASE1_100_TEST_COMMON_PATTERNS.md`:

- ✅ **45+ test cases**: 93+ tests implemented
- ✅ **TESTING.md**: Comprehensive testing documentation
- ✅ **test/ directory**: Organized test structure
- ✅ **Hardhat framework**: Primary development framework
